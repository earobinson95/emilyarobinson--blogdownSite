I am currently pursuing a Ph.D in Statistics at University of Nebraska - Lincoln. As a graduate student, I have experience teaching calculus based introductory statistics and consulting / collaborating with researchers from departments across the university. 

I am passionate about communicating statistics whether I am teaching and mentoring students or working on a research project with domain experts. To learn more about me, keep exploring my site or reach out directly.
