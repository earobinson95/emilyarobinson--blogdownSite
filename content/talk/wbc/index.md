abstract: Larvae from western bean cutworms (WBC) can cause kernel damage in corn.       Insecticide application timing is sensitive due to the larvaeas movement inside the    ears of corn, thus only being exposed to the insecticide between oviposition and       entry into the corn. The aim of this analysis is to use multivariate approaches to     characterize the WBC flight pattern and historical changes from 1981-2017.Researchers   trapped moths at Concord, Clay Center, North Platte, and Aurora. Previous analys       grouped the data into five year periods and modeled univariate ANOVA to compare the    total number of moths captured, flight lengths, days from first capture to peak        flight, and days from peak flight to last capture. In order to quantify the entire     flight pattern, we used latent growth curve modeling to explain the start date,        intercept, and the length of flight, slope, as latent variables based on the observed   summary statistics such as day of the year flight began (DOTYfirst), day of the year   25% of the flight was finished (DOTY25pct), day of the year 50% of the flight was      finished (DOTY50pct), day of the year 75% of the flight was finished (DOTY75pct), and   day of the year flight ended (DOTYlast). Covariates used to predict the latent start   date and length include weather based on average temperature and total precipitation   as well as moth abundance based on total moths and peak moths. The yearly changes      were then plotted with an overlaying loess curve in order to visualize the changes in   flight pattern across the entire time frame. Characterizing the changes in the flight   distribution allows growers to determine the best insecticide application time.
