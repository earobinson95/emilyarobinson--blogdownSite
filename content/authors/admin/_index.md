Hi there :wave: I'm Emily! 

I recently finished my Ph.D. in statistics from the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. My current research, in collaboration with [Dr. Susan VanderPlas](https://srvanderplas.netlify.app/) and Dr. Reka Howard, focuses on the use of graphical tests to evaluate data visualization design choices in order to effectively communicate the intended result. I am currently learning how to create interactive visualizations using D3.js. I am passionate about teaching, mentoring, and collaboration.


I am excited to be joining the faculty in the [Department of Statistics at CalPoly](https://statistics.calpoly.edu/) in San Luis Obispo, CA in fall 2022!


Outside of work, I enjoy outdoor recreation :runner: :bicyclist: :ski:, gardening :sunflower: :herb: , and reading :books: [(check out *Reese's Book Club Picks*)](https://hello-sunshine.com/post/reeses-book-club-all-picks)!
