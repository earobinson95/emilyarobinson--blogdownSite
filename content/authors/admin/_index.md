I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in statistics at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln with an expected graduation date of August 2022. I have 2.5+ years of statistical consulting experience working with more than 75 clients, 3+ years teaching experience with introductory statistics and HS geometry, and 3 summers applying statistics for different industry functions. My research interests involve graphical testing, experimental design, and statistical consulting. I am skilled in creating data visualizations in order to effectively communicate critical information and am currently learning D3.js. I am passionate about communicating statistics whether I am teaching or collaborating on a project.
