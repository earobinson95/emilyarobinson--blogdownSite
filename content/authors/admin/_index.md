Hi! I'm Emily, a Ph.D. candidate and statistical consultant in the Department of Statistics at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln.

I have:
+ 2.5+ years of statistical consulting experience working with over 75 clients
+ 3+ years of teaching experience with introductory statistics and HS geometry
+ 3 summers applying statistics for different industry functions.

My current research at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln in collaboration with my advisers, [Dr. Susan VanderPlas](https://srvanderplas.netlify.app/) and Dr. Reka Howard, focuses on the use of graphical tests to evaluate the effectiveness of data visualizations in communicating the intended result. I am skilled in creating data visualizations in order to effectively communicate critical information and am currently learning D3.js. I am passionate about teaching, mentoring, and collaboration. 

Outside of being a graduate student, I enjoy outdoor recreation (in all seasons), gardening, and reading [(check out *Reese's Book Club Picks*)](https://hello-sunshine.com/post/reeses-book-club-all-picks)!
