I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Statistics at University of Nebraska - Lincoln. I have 2.5+ years statistical consulting experience working with more than 75 clients, 3+ years teaching experience with introductory statistics and HS geometry, and 3 summers (1 year) applying statistics for different industry functions. My research interests involve experimental design and perception and decision making using graphics. I am skilled in creating data visualizations in order to effectively communicate critical information and am currently learning D3.js. I am passionate about communicating statistics whether I am teaching or collaborating on a project.
