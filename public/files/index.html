## P.O.W.E.R Survey</p>
<ul>
<li>P.O.W.E.R Survey (Purpose, Ownership, Wellness, Engagement, Relationships)
<ul>
<li>Sent to all UNL Freshman in the fourth week of the Fall 2019 semeseter (1788 responses, 38.3% response rate)</li>
<li>11 Binary Questions</li>
<li>Outreach to Res Life, Student Inolvement, Big Red Resilience, Office of Academic Success &amp; intercultural Services (OASIS), First-Year Experience and Transition Programs (FYETP), Husker Hub, University Advising</li>
</ul></li>

## Student Demographic Data
- Academic Management Information System (AMIS Database) [<a href="https://iea.unl.edu/" class="uri">https://iea.unl.edu/</a>]
- Snapshot of UNL’s data taken each semeseter (Fall, Spring, Summer)
- <em>e.g. age, gender, first time freshman, honors, first gen, athlete, scholarship athlete, resident status, full time or part time, college, degree, department, AP credit, ACT test, HS GPA, transfer student, sections enrolled, final GPA, 2nd year college, 3rd year college, degree in number of years, term graduated, etc.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) Survey [<a href="http://nsse.indiana.edu/" class="uri">http://nsse.indiana.edu/</a>]
<ul>
<li>Five levels: Level of academic challenge, active and collaborative learning, student-faculty interaction, enriching educational experiences, and supportive campus environment.</li>
<li>UNL participated in the NSSE in 2007, 2010, 2011 (Pilot study), 2012 (Pilot study), 2013, 2016 [response rate: 27% for freshman &amp; 23% for seniors), and 2019 [HIP’s, Inclusiveness and Engagement with Cultural Diversity, Association of American Universities Data Exchange - AAUDE] [<a href="https://www.unl.edu/nsse/" class="uri">https://www.unl.edu/nsse/</a>]</li>

## Introduction to Visual Inference</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Data plots <span class="math inline">\(\equiv\)</span> test statistics</p></li>
<li><p>Plots of data generated from a null hypothesis (e.g. bootstrapping) using a lineup.</p></li>
<li><p>A lineup contians one “guilty” plot randomly placed among a field of “innocent” or null plots.</p></li>
<li><p>If the null hypothesis is true then the plot of the data will not be distinguishable
from the plots of null data.</p></li>
<li><p>Viewers asked to identify the plot that is the most different.</p></li>
<li><p>If the viewer identifies the suspect, it lends statistical significance to the conclusion that the data is not consistent with the null data.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement study with Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowd sourcing website.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a Binomial Distriution, expect to see the “guilty” plot selected <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\text{Number of Plots}}\)</span> times by random chance.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Think 218 with simulated p-values in Chapters 5 and 6.</li>

## Future Thoughts
- I have found that I enjoy spending my time on:
- Experimental Design
- Communicating Statistics (e.g. Consulting and Teaching)
- Data Science
- Nonlinear Analysis
- Structural Equation Modleing (SEM)</p>
<ul>
<li>Considerations with Sense of Belonging:
<ul>
<li>Reliability &amp; validity of survey.</li>
<li>The survey is binary.</li>
<li>The questions target different aspects of a student’s sense of belonging, can we tie them all together with psychometrics to come up with one measure?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Possible directions:
<ul>
<li>Combine visual inference and survey data (item response theroy - IRT).</li>
<li>Detecting bias due to missing data (or correcting for non-response rates)</li>
<li>Mainstream visual inference into consulting practices.</li>
<li>Model evaluation / diagnostics of GLMM, Nonlinear Models, and Nonlinear Mixed models using Visual Inference</li>
</ul></li>

## Impossible and Insane Idea
- Blumenstock, J., Cadamuro, G., &amp; On, R. (2015). Predicting poverty and wealth from mobile phone metadata. Science, 350(6264), 1073–1076. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aac4420" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aac4420</a></p>

<li>Accurate and timely estimates of population characteristics are a critical input to social
and economic research and policy. In industrialized economies, novel sources of data are
enabling new approaches to demographic profiling, but in developing countries, fewer
sources of big data exist. We show that <strong>an individual’s past history of mobile phone use can
be used to infer his or her socioeconomic status</strong>. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
<strong>predicted attributes of millions of individuals can, in turn, accurately reconstruct the
distribution of wealth of an entire nation or to infer the asset distribution of microregions
composed of just a few households</strong>. In resource-constrained environments where censuses
and household surveys are rare, this approach creates an option for gathering localized
and timely information at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods.</li>
